# Cv-site/WorkBoard
## Unfinished project that was written on Laravel+Vue.js

**Requarements**

1. Docker
If you have Windows 10 before you need to install WSL 2:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
Here you will find documentation for Docker Desktop:
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/
2. Laravel Sail
Project using Laravel Sail for work with Docker.
I don't think that you have to need to install it cuz i have installed it
before and it should work already but anyway here you can find documentation:
https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sail
